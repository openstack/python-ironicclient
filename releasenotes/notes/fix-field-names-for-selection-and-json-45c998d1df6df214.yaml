    All baremetal list commands now use actual resource field names
    (e.g., "uuid", "name", "resource_class") as column headers instead
    of human-friendly labels (e.g., "UUID", "Name", "Resource Class").
    This change ensures consistency between table output, JSON output,
    and field selection via the ``--fields`` option.

    **Action Required**: Scripts that parse the output of baremetal list
    commands will need to be updated to use the new lowercase,
    snake_case column headers. For example:

    - "UUID" → "uuid"
    - "Name" → "name"
    - "Resource Class" → "resource_class"
    - "Instance UUID" → "instance_uuid"
    - "Power State" → "power_state"
    - "Provisioning State" → "provision_state"
    - "Supported driver(s)" → "name"
    - "Active host(s)" → "hosts"

    This affects all list commands including node list, port list,
    portgroup list, allocation list, chassis list, conductor list,
    deploy template list, driver list, volume connector list,
    volume target list, runbook list, shard list, and inspection rule list.

fixes:

    Fixes an inconsistency where column headers in list command table
    output used different names than the actual resource fields,
    causing confusion when using the ``--fields`` option or comparing
    with JSON output format (``-f json``).
