    The ``health`` field has been removed from the default columns in
    ``baremetal node list`` output. This aligns the CLI with the Ironic API,
    which does not include health in default node list responses. The health
    field remains available via ``baremetal node list --long`` or
    ``baremetal node list --fields health``.
