    Adds support for displaying the node health status field (``health``)
    in the baremetal node list commands. This field exposes the Redfish
    hardware health status (Status.Health) that is synchronized from BMCs
    to Ironic node records. The health field is displayed by default in
    both standard and long listing formats, providing operators with
    visibility into the hardware health status of managed nodes. This
    requires Ironic API version ``1.109`` or later.
